# Privacy Policy

This policy applies to all information collected or submitted in Solarc for iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad, and any other devices and platforms.

## Our stance on privacy

We strongly believe that your data belongs to you. We do not collect any identifiable information about our users; we only track the bare minimum needed to debug issues, to view download and purchase trends, and to figure out what to work on next.

## What information does Solarc collect?

Solarc collects anonymized metadata using Appleâ€™s built in metrics system. This system sends data such as session length, crash reports, device type, and locale.

Finally, Solarc collects some simple, aggregate, anonymous statistics about the usage of certain key features within the app. This data is used to decide what features are popular and where to spend additional development time to enhance those features.

No other information is collected at any time. Any data you enter into Solarc resides strictly on your device and in your personal iCloud account. We have no means of viewing any user-entered data.

## What does Solarc do with this data?

Anonymized crash reports and device info are used to fix crashes within the app. Your anonymized device data may also be used to prioritize support for translating to certain languages. Total download count and other aggregated metrics may be used for marketing purposes, or for making decisions about features to add or improve.

## Your consent

By using Solarc, you consent to this privacy policy.

## Changes to this policy

Changes to this privacy policy may periodically be made and posted here. Visit this page at any time to check for updates.
